## 2. Personality and Attitudes

### a) Meaning of Personality

🧠 *Definition:* The set of traits and behaviors that make a person unique
(How you think, feel, and act)

### b) Personality Determinants and Traits

#### 🔹 **Determinants** = *“What shapes your personality”*

Think of it as the **ingredients** that make you *you*.

1. **Heredity** – From your genes. Example: natural temperament or intelligence.
2. **Environment** – Family, culture, school, society. All that affects your growth.
3. **Situation** – How you act can depend on the moment. Example: You're chill at home but serious in class.

#### 🔹 **Traits** = *“Your permanent personality features”*

These are **stable behaviors** or **ways of thinking** you often show.

Here come the **Big Five Personality Traits** — super simple and with examples:

---

🌟 **1. Openness to Experience**

* **Meaning:** You love trying new things, being creative, open to ideas.
* **High:** Curious, imaginative
* **Low:** Practical, prefers routine

👉 *Example:* You love exploring new tech, games, or coding styles? High Openness!

---

📋 **2. Conscientiousness**

* **Meaning:** How disciplined and organized you are.
* **High:** Responsible, hardworking, detail-oriented
* **Low:** Lazy, careless, unorganized

👉 *Example:* If you plan your study schedule & meet deadlines – you’re high here!

---

🗣️ **3. Extraversion**

* **Meaning:** How outgoing or social you are.
* **High:** Talkative, energetic, loves social settings
* **Low:** Reserved, quiet, prefers being alone

👉 *Example:* Love group projects and chatting a lot? Extravert!

---

🤝 **4. Agreeableness**

* **Meaning:** How kind, cooperative, and trusting you are.
* **High:** Friendly, helpful, empathetic
* **Low:** Critical, rude, selfish

👉 *Example:* Always ready to help friends with code? That’s agreeableness!

---

😰 **5. Neuroticism**

* **Meaning:** Emotional stability – how much you handle stress.
* **High:** Anxious, moody, easily upset
* **Low:** Calm, stable, chill

👉 *Example:* Panic before exams = High neuroticism. Cool even in pressure? Low.

---

So:

➡ **Determinants = What creates personality**

➡ **Traits = What personality looks like**

---

### c) Development of Personality

🧬 Grows with age, life experiences, learning, and environment. Early childhood matters a lot.

### d) Types of Attitudes

1. **Job Satisfaction** – How happy you are with your job
2. **Job Involvement** – How much you care about your work
3. **Organizational Commitment** – Loyalty to the company
4. **Positive/Negative Attitude** – Optimism vs. Pessimism

### e) Job Satisfaction

😊 Depends on:

* Pay
* Work conditions
* Relationships
* Growth opportunities
* Job security
  
📌 High satisfaction → better performance, low turnover

#### 🔄 **Turnover** = People **leaving** a company (resignation/quit)

* High turnover = Many people quitting
* Low turnover = Employees stay longer

It’s a sign of job satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

---

# Unit 2 – Perception & Motivation

## 1. Perception

### a) Definition, Nature & Importance**

🔹 *Definition:* Perception is how we interpret and understand sensory info (what we see, hear, feel).

🔹 *Nature:* It’s subjective — everyone sees things differently!

🔹 *Importance:* Affects how people behave, judge others, and make decisions in the workplace.

### b) Factors Influencing Perception

🧠 Influenced by:

* **Personal factors** – past experiences, motives, mood, personality
* **Target factors** – what you’re looking at (size, color, motion)
* **Situational factors** – time, place, work setting

### c) Perceptual Selectivity

👀 We *choose* what to notice (can’t focus on everything!)
Depends on:

* **Intensity** (loud sound catches attention)
* 🔁 **Repetition:** If you see or hear something again and again, your brain starts noticing it more.

    ➡ *Example:* An ad jingle playing 10 times – now you can't forget it!

* 🎨 **Contrast:** Things that are *different* or *stand out* catch your eye.

    ➡ *Example:* A person in neon pink in a room full of people in black.

* **Personal interest**

### d) Link between Perception & Decision Making

⚡ Perception shapes how you see a problem → affects your decision.

Example: If you *perceive* someone as lazy (even wrongly), you may not trust their ideas.

➡ Bad perception = bad decision-making

---

## 2. Motivation and it's theories

💡*Motivation* = The internal drive to achieve goals or perform work.

---

### 🧗 Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

➡ Needs in 5 levels (bottom to top):

1. **Physiological** – Food, water, rest
2. **Safety** – Job security, health
3. **Social** – Friends, love, teamwork
4. **Esteem** – Respect, achievement
5. **Self-actualization** – Personal growth, fulfilling potential
   📌 Must fulfill lower needs before higher ones.

---

### 👨‍💼 McGregor’s Theory X & Y

* **Theory X:** People are lazy, dislike work → need control
* **Theory Y:** People like work, seek responsibility → support them

➡ Modern workplaces prefer **Theory Y**!

---

### 🧪 **Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory**

🧠 He says:

> There are **two different sets of factors** that affect job satisfaction.

---

#### 🛁 1. **Hygiene Factors** = Basics

* These **don’t motivate**, but if they’re missing, people get unhappy.
* They’re like *cleanliness* – you don’t praise it, but you notice if it’s missing.

**Examples:**

* Salary 💸
* Company policies 📝
* Work conditions 🏢
* Job security 🔐
* Supervision 👨‍💼
  ➡ If any of these are bad → dissatisfaction
  ➡ But even if they’re good → not *super* motivated

---

#### ✨ 2. **Motivators** = What truly inspires you

* These **actually increase satisfaction and performance**
* Related to the *work itself*

**Examples:**

* Achievement 🏆
* Recognition 👏
* Responsibility 💼
* Growth & promotion 📈
* Meaningful work 💡

➡ These make people feel **excited**, proud, and engaged

---

#### 🌈 Simple Analogy

Think of a video game 🎮

* **Hygiene factors = Game settings** (smooth controls, no lag)
  
  → If broken, you rage quit 😤

* **Motivators = Winning levels, unlocking rewards**

  → That’s what keeps you playing 🔥

---

So Herzberg says:

> ✅ Fix hygiene first → so people aren’t unhappy
>
> ✅ Then add motivators → so people feel truly driven

---

### 🔁 Alderfer’s ERG Theory

Simplified Maslow into 3:

* **Existence** – basic needs
* **Relatedness** – relationships
* **Growth** – personal development

💡 Unlike Maslow, needs can overlap.

---

### 💼 McClelland’s Theory of Needs

Focuses on 3 key needs:

1. **Achievement** – Desire to succeed
2. **Power** – Control, influence others
3. **Affiliation** – Friendly relationships

   ➡ Different people are motivated by different needs.

---

### 🧮 Vroom’s Expectancy Theory

Formula style:
**Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence**

* **Expectancy** – “Can I do this task?”
* **Instrumentality** – “Will I get rewarded if I do it?”
* **Valence** – “Do I care about the reward?”

➡ If any of these is zero, motivation is zero!

#### ⚙️ Vroom’s Expectancy Theory – EXAMPLE

Let’s say you're given a coding task during your internship.

* **Expectancy:** Can I do it?
  ➡ "Yes, I know enough JavaScript to finish it!" ✅

* **Instrumentality:** Will I be rewarded if I do it well?
  ➡ "Yes, my mentor said good work gets noticed and may lead to a full-time offer!" ✅

* **Valence:** Do I want the reward?
  ➡ "Heck yes, I want that full-time role!" ✅

➡ **Motivation = High!** 🔥

BUT if even one is zero...

➡ You *can* do it (Expectancy ✅)
➡ You *will* get a reward (Instrumentality ✅)
➡ But you *don’t care* about the reward (Valence ❌)

➡ Motivation = 0 😴

---

## 🔁 **Quick One-Line Memory Hooks (All Theories)**

1. **Maslow's Hierarchy:**

    > **Legendary Line:** *Phsy socializes safely ento sea* 🧜‍♀️🌊
    > Breakdown:

    * **Phsy** = Physiological
    * **Socializes** = Social
    * **Safely** = Safety
    * **Ento** = Esteem
    * **Sea** = Self-Actualization

   ➡ Climb the pyramid: *Food → Safety → Friends → Respect → Growth*

2. **McGregor:**
   **McGregor’s Theory = Mewtwo’s dual forms** —

    * **X Form** = Dark, aggressive → needs control 😤
    * **Y Form** = Calm, psychic → thrives with support 🧘‍♀️✨

   ➡ *Mewtwo X = control, Mewtwo Y = support*

3. **Herzberg:**

   ➡ *No motivators = no excitement, no hygiene = complaints!* (Fix both!)

4. **Alderfer’s ERG:**

   ➡ *Exist, Relate, Grow* – not always in order.

5. **McClelland:**

   ➡ *APA = Achievement, Power, Affiliation* – different strokes for different folks.

6. **Vroom's Expectancy:**

   ➡ *Can I × Will I × Do I care = Motivation*

   ➡ *EIV = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence = Motivation*

# UNIT 3 – Group Vibes, Talk Power, and Leading Like a Boss

---

## 1. Group Behaviour

### a) 👥 Characteristics of Groups

1. **Two or more people** – A single person = no group 😛
2. **Common Goal** – They unite for a purpose 🎯
3. **Structured Interaction** – There’s a pattern to how they communicate or act 🧩
4. **Shared Identity** – They feel like part of the same “us” 🤝
5. **Mutual Influence** – Members affect each other’s thoughts & behavior 🔄

### b) Types of Groups

* **Formal:** Assigned by the organization (e.g., project team)
* **Informal:** Natural/social (e.g., lunch buddies)

### c) Stages of Group Development (Tuckman’s Model)

1. **Forming** – Getting to know each other
2. **Storming** – Conflicts and clashing ideas 💥
3. **Norming** – Roles are clear, working together
4. **Performing** – Efficient teamwork 💪
5. **Adjourning** – Wrapping up, saying goodbye 👋

🎶 Just say: *Form Storm Norm Perform Adjourn* in one go. Keep saying it to remember.

### d) Group Decision Making

✅ *Pros:* Diverse ideas, better solutions

❌ *Cons:* Slower, conflicts, groupthink (people agree just to fit in)

---

## 2. Communication

### 🌩️ Noise in Communication

**Anything that disrupts the message** from sender to receiver.

**Examples of Noise:**

* **Physical:** Loud room, poor network = can’t hear properly
* **Psychological:** You’re upset, so you misread a friendly message 😤
* **Semantic:** Big jargon words = “What does that even mean?” 😵
* **Technical:** Typing errors, glitchy mic 🎤💥

➡ Misinterpretations *can* be caused by noise, but noise is a broader category!

### a) Communication Process

1. **Sender** – idea
2. **Encoding** – turn idea into message
3. **Channel** – how it’s sent (verbal, written)
4. **Receiver** – gets message
5. **Decoding** – interprets it
6. **Feedback** – response

> **Memory line:**
>
>`Sender` → `encodes` → `sends via channel` → `receiver` → `decodes` → `feedback happens`
>
>➡ Noise can mess it up anytime!

### b) Direction of Communication

* **Upward:** From employee to manager
* **Downward:** From boss to team
* **Horizontal:** Between coworkers
* **Diagonal:** It’s when communication happens *across levels and departments*, not just up-down or side-to-side.

  **Example:** An intern in the HR dept talks directly to the Finance Manager about reimbursement.

  ➡ Different department + different level = **Diagonal** (It skips the direct boss in between!)

### c) Barriers to Effective Communication

1. **Physical Barriers:**

   Noise, Walls, distance, poor equipment

   ➡ E.g., Bad mic in a Zoom meeting = miscommunication

2. **Semantic Barriers:**

   Confusing words, jargon, unclear language

   ➡ Saying “synergy” to someone new to corporate = Misunderstood words

3. **Psychological Barriers:**

   Attitude, Emotions, stress, prejudice

   ➡ “He never listens to me anyway” → you stop being clear

4. **Organizational Barriers:**

   Too many levels of hierarchy, unclear reporting

   ➡ Message passes through 4 managers and changes every time!

---

## 3. Leadership

### a) Definition

Leadership = Influencing and guiding people to achieve goals.

### b) Importance

* Builds morale 🫂
* Gives direction 🧭
* Drives productivity ⚙️
* Resolves conflicts 🤝

### c) Theories of Leadership Styles

📌 *Common styles:*

1. **Autocratic Leadership (Bossy):**

   🔹 Leader makes all decisions, expects obedience.

   ➡ *E.g., Military commander during a crisis*

2. **Democratic Leadership (Participative):**

   🔹 Leader involves team in decision-making.

   ➡ *E.g., A tech team brainstorming features with their manager*

3. **Laissez-Faire Leadership (Hands-off):**

   🔹 Leader gives full freedom, only offers help if asked.

   ➡ *E.g., A creative director letting designers work freely*

📌 *In short:*

* **Autocratic:** Boss-centered 👑 “My way!”
* **Democratic:** Team-centered 🤝 “Let’s decide together”
* **Laissez-Faire:** Hands-off 🧘 “Do your thing”

---

## Lightning Recap of Unit 3 ⚡

---

### 🔹 **Group Behaviour**

* **Groups:** People with shared goals & interaction
* **Types:** Formal (assigned), Informal (natural)
* **Stages:**
  🌀 *Forming → Storming → Norming → Performing → Adjourning*
  *(a dramatic arc worthy of Netflix)*

---

### 🔹 **Communication**

* **Process:** Sender → Encode → Channel → Decode → Receiver → Feedback
* **Directions:**
  🔼 Upward | 🔽 Downward | ➡️ Horizontal | 🔀 Diagonal
* **Barriers:**
  🧱 Physical, Semantic, Psychological, Organizational

# 🏛️ UNIT 4 – Power Plays, Peace Talks, and How Orgs Are Built

---

## 1. Organizational Politics

### a) Definition

Use of power and influence in organizations to get personal or group interests done — often unofficial ways 👀

### b) 🔥 **Factors Contributing to Political Behaviour (with examples)**

1. **Limited Resources**

   * 🧁 *Example:* Only one person can attend an expensive training program, so employees start lobbying for themselves.

2. **Ambiguity in Roles**

   * ❓ *Example:* Two managers are unsure who controls a project — both try to influence top management to gain control.

3. **Self-Interest**

   * 😈 *Example:* Someone leaks a co-worker’s mistake to look better for a promotion.

4. **High Competition**

   * ⚔️ *Example:* Employees subtly sabotage each other during performance review season.

5. **Lack of Transparency**

   * 🔒 *Example:* Decisions are made behind closed doors — people start making assumptions and forming alliances.

🧠 Think: *When there's uncertainty + ambition, politics pop in!*

---

## 2. Conflict Management

### a) Traditional vs. Modern View of Conflict

* **Traditional View:** Conflict is BAD 😤 (avoid it)
* **Modern View:** Conflict is NATURAL 🧠 (manage it well, it can help grow)

### b) ⚔️ **Functional vs. Dysfunctional Conflict**

| Type              | Meaning                       | Example                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional**    | Positive, productive conflict | A team debates over two designs and ends up creating the perfect blend.           |
| **Dysfunctional** | Negative, harmful conflict    | Two employees fight over credit and stop cooperating, delaying the whole project. |

💡 **Key Difference:**

* Functional = Healthy tension ➤ Growth

* Dysfunctional = Toxic clash ➤ Damage

### c) 🎭 **Conflict Process (with mini example)**

Imagine two designers, A and B:

1. **Potential Opposition:**
   – A gets credit for a logo B helped design.

2. **Cognition & Personalization:**
   – B feels ignored, starts feeling resentful.

3. **Intentions:**
   – B considers confronting A or staying quiet.

4. **Behavior:**
   – B argues with A during a meeting.

5. **Outcome:**

   – If they talk it out ➤ Resolved.

   If not ➤ More tension next time.

🎭 It's like a story arc: Trigger → Tension → Reaction → Drama → Ending

#### Memory line: `PECIBO`

### d) 🤝 Negotiation

### a) Bargaining Strategies

* **Distributive (Win-Lose):**
  🥧 “We have one cake, let’s split it.”
  *Example:* Employee negotiates salary — if the company gives more, it loses budget.

* **Integrative (Win-Win):**
  🎂 “Let’s bake a bigger cake.”
  *Example:* A freelancer wants more pay, so they offer to take on additional responsibilities too.

### b) Negotiation Process Example: Buying a Used Laptop**

1. **Prep & Planning**:
   – Research market price, list your needs.

2. **Define Ground Rules**:
   – Agree to meet, talk, and share specs.

3. **Clarify & Justify**:
   – Seller explains value, buyer explains budget.

4. **Bargain & Problem-Solve**:
   – They agree: buyer gets laptop + accessories at a discount.

5. **Close & Implement**:
   – Deal sealed with payment and pickup.

*Memory Line: Imagine you're buying a laptop.*

---

## 3. Organizational Design

### a) 🏗️ Organizational Structures = Blueprint of Behaviour

Let’s say lack of transparency creeps in:

* **Functional:**
  → Departments based on function (HR, Finance).
  → Departments can get *siloed*, only talking within their own walls — low coordination.

* **Divisional:**
  → Based on products/regions.
  → Duplicate efforts if one product team doesn’t know what others are doing.

* **Matrix:**
  → Mix of `Functional` and `Divisional` Structures — dual reporting (Dynamic + Flexibility + Sometimes Confusions).
  → “Am I reporting to my team lead or my project head?” Confusion = 👀 politics alert.

* **Flat:**
  → Fewer levels, wide span, fast flow and more employee empowerment.
  → Less hierarchy = faster, but people may be unsure who decides what.

* **Tall:**
  → More levels of hierarchy. Clear authority, but slower decisions.
  → Clear rules, but info moves slowly 🐢 = secrecy risk.

So yes — **structure really shapes trust, flow, and transparency**.

#### Memory Line: `DMTFF`

### b) 🌤️ Organizational Climate (Current mood 🌦️)

**The vibe check of the workplace.**

### 🔹 Definition

The *current atmosphere or mood* in the organization — how employees feel **right now** about policies, leadership, teamwork, etc.

### 🔹 Features

* Temporary and changeable
* Affected by management, events, stress
* Example:
  If there's fear of layoffs, the **climate** may feel tense and anxious.

---

### b)🧬 **Organizational Culture (Deep values + shared ways 📖)**

**The personality + DNA of the company.**

### 🔹 Definition

The **deep, shared beliefs, values, and norms** that guide how employees behave over the long term.

### 🔹 Features

* Stable and rooted
* Built over time through stories, rituals, symbols
* Example:
  A company that values innovation might have a *culture* of encouraging wild ideas and risk-taking.

---

### ⚡ **Climate vs. Culture Simplified:**

| Aspect        | Climate 🌦️              | Culture 🧬                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Nature        | Temporary, felt          | Deep-rooted, believed                |
| Focus         | Mood and behavior        | Values and core principles           |
| Changeability | Can shift quickly        | Harder to change, evolves slowly     |
| Example       | "Feels stressful lately" | "We value teamwork and transparency" |

---

🎯 **Summary:**

* **Climate = Weather report** 🌦️
* **Culture = The whole climate zone** 🌍

---
